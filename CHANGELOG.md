# Changelog

All notable changes contributed via pull request are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

- Server Mode requires a login. Set the password with `PRINTVENTORY_PASSWORD`, or use the one printed in the server log on first start, and change it under Tools → Server Access
- MCP clients authenticate with an API token; the MCP client config includes it
- The file and download endpoints only serve files inside the library folders, plus backups and exports. The live database and certificates can no longer be downloaded
- The server no longer serves server code, `node_modules`, `package.json` or the support webhook file
- WebSocket connections and state-changing requests from other websites are refused
- Send to Slicer links carry a short-lived download token. Reinstall the helper from Settings → Slicer
- Browser and MCP requests can only read, delete or move files inside the library folders. Scans and Organize Library cannot target system or app folders, and MCP backups and exports only write to the library or data folder
- Security headers on every response, and `X-Powered-By` removed
- Replaced the abandoned `xmldom` with `@xmldom/xmldom`, updated Puppeteer to 25, and applied the other dependency security fixes
- The Docker image builds without `support-webhook.json`; Send Support Logs then uses `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
- Symlinks inside the library cannot be used to read or write files outside it
- `PRINTVENTORY_TRUST_PROXY` lets the login rate limit see real client addresses behind a reverse proxy
- Removed the legacy `/api/extension-upload` route and its upload-directory setting (`EXTENSION_UPLOAD_DIR`). The extension uses the inbox folder
- The Docker container runs as a regular user. Set `PUID`/`PGID` to the owner of your library files (default 1000:1000; `PUID=0` keeps root). The data folder is re-owned on first start
- The Docker image includes Electron instead of downloading it on every new container's first start
- Docker reports the container as healthy or unhealthy (`HEALTHCHECK`)
- Usage tracking (GoatCounter) is removed, and old tracking settings are deleted from the database
- The startup update check waits for the terms to be accepted, follows the beta channel for beta users, and can be turned off under About → Updates

## [2.2.16] - 2026-10-02

- Organize Library copies models from a scanned folder into a folder structure you choose, checks free space, and removes each original only after the copy is verified. Zip archives can move packed when zip support is on
- De-duplication can keep the copy that lives under a preferred directory, including files in subfolders

## [2.2.15] - 2026-10-02

- Startup repairs tag links that still point at a removed models table, and retries a tag save that failed for that reason
- Tag names are inserted as text, so a tag cannot inject markup into the page
- Tag rename and other text prompts open in a sandboxed window
- The details name no longer snaps back to the previous model when the filter or selection changes
- The grid keeps the selected model selected when it repaints
- Exporting the library and loading print history read each related table once
- Send Logs in installed builds reads a bundled support webhook. The webhook URL stays out of the repository

## [2.2.14] - 2026-10-02

- Tag from Folder can run on files a scan newly adds, using the folder levels from AI Configuration, without calling AI
- Scans say how many files were skipped because they are larger than the max file size
- Selecting a folder inside a zip matches entries stored with mixed slashes, and does not include a sibling folder with a similar name
- Thumbnail updates keep your place in the library
- The path tree shows distinct folder, file, and zip icons
- Server mode scan and database progress events reach the page
- Stopping the Docker container exits cleanly
- Switching between detailed and preview keeps the selected model selected and in view

## [2.2.13] - 2026-10-01

- Saving slicer settings says which name or path is already used when two entries match
- Server and Docker mode can Send to Slicer through a local helper. Slicer Settings downloads a package already set to this server. The installer registers a printventory:// protocol on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and downloads the official Node.js LTS release when Node is not already installed.
- STL Home accepts a list of directories, using the same add and remove controls as excluded directories
- Startup scans every STL Home directory, on the desktop and in Docker
- STL_HOME accepts one path or several, separated the same way as STL_HOME_EXCLUDE

## [2.2.12] - 2026-10-01

- Library scans skip folders that start with a dot, extra folder names you list, and directories excluded from STL Home
- Search can leave notes out of all-fields search
- AI tagging sends parent folder names and the model description, waits out rate limits, and Tag from Folder applies those folder names without calling the AI
- Open in Slicer starts another instance when that slicer is already running
- STL preview rejects files that are not a real STL
- Help menu can send a redacted support log
- Linux AppImage starts without the setuid sandbox helper

## [2.2.11] - 2026-09-29

- Printer Management: save printers, maintenance logs, and scheduled reminders
- Parts Stock inventory, deducted when a print is logged
- Markdown model notes
- Detect installed slicers from Settings
- Filament manager shows how many models use each spool, with a collapsible add form

## [2.2.10] - 2026-09-20

- ChiTuBox (`.chitubox`) and VOXL (`.voxl`) thumbnails/previews from embedded images when present
- Preview wall: open button labeled **Preview** and centered; `...` menu no longer sits under the selection check
- Studio disabled for image-only formats (F3D, ChiTuBox, VOXL)
- Stop infinite thumbnail retry hang when image-only files have no embedded preview

## [2.2.9] - 2026-09-19

- F3D thumbnails and 3D preview from Fusion’s embedded `Previews/small.png`
- File Type settings save no longer fails in Docker/server when unchecking a type (`getAdditionalFileTypesCatalog` missing)

## [2.2.8] - 2026-09-18

- STEP/STP thumbnails and 3D preview, including assemblies that only reference sibling part files
- LYS thumbnails from embedded `preview.png`, or by rendering the stored mesh when no preview image exists
- OBJ 3D preview (library thumbs already rendered OBJ)
- PLY and IGES thumbnails and 3D preview

## [2.2.7] - 2026-09-17

- 3D Preview Studio: lighting, materials, backdrops, reflections, shadows, and save image
- Multi-part 3MF part picker and click-to-focus in preview

## [2.2.6] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- **Tag Manager rename** — Click a tag to rename it across the library (for example a typo). Clear the name and press Enter to delete it ([#82](https://github.com/TechJeeper/Printventory/issues/82)).
- Multi-Edit **Edit Tags** opens Tag Manager. Untag from selected models stays on that panel.

### Changed

- Preview tiles show filenames without hovering ([#81](https://github.com/TechJeeper/Printventory/issues/81)).
- Click an expanded folder or ZIP group to collapse it. Click empty grid space to deselect the selected model.
- **AI Tagging** — Local OpenAI-compatible servers (Custom, Ollama, LM Studio, and similar) no longer require an API key.

### Fixed

- Tag Manager Full Screen resizes the dialog and keeps existing tags visible ([#80](https://github.com/TechJeeper/Printventory/issues/80)).
- The library grid no longer stays empty on launch until you switch views.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- **List view columns** — Show/hide columns, drag header edges to resize, and drag headers to reorder. The layout is saved.
- Zip/group list rows use the same columns, with aggregated size, date added, parent directory, designer, parent model, print status, and tags.
- **AI Tagging: Claude** — Settings → AI Tagging includes Claude alongside OpenAI, Gemini, and Puter (default model `claude-haiku-4-5`).
- **MCP** — Additional library tools for tags, filaments, print events, parent models, metadata rename/delete, thumbnails, duplicates, and hash status.

### Changed

- List view **Printed** column is now **Print Status**.
- List sort headers show an arrow only (no background highlight).

## [2.2.4] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- **HTTPS / SSL settings** — Settings → HTTPS / SSL for server, Docker, and the desktop Browser Extension / MCP listener. Custom PEM paths, Let's Encrypt (HTTP-01), or a self-signed cert (defaults to localhost). Env `PRINTVENTORY_TLS_*` still overrides the UI.
- Server/Docker **HTTPS / SSL** settings include a listen port (default 5000) so the app can bind something other than DSM's port 5000. Map the same port on the host (`PRINTVENTORY_PORT` seeds the setting when empty).
- **PWA / mobile UI** — Server and Docker can be installed as a PWA; phones get a compact layout.
- **Browser Extension inbox** — Printventory Watcher can queue model pages/downloads without the app running; Settings imports from the inbox folder.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **Print lifecycle and history** — Status is no longer a Printed checkbox. Each model has Unprinted / Want / Queued / Printing / Printed / Failed, plus an append-only print log (date, Printed/Failed/Cancelled, quantity, notes, filaments used). Click a card badge to log a print (reprints increment `Printed ×N`); Shift-click changes status only. Details panel has a status dropdown, Log a print, and a deletable history list. Filters include each status plus Ever printed / Never printed (from successful logs). Sort by last printed, print count, or status. Existing `printed = 1` rows keep Printed with “No logged prints yet” — no fake history is invented. Send to Slicer does not auto-log a print.
- **Folder-tree library explorer** — A Folders filter (roots + recent) with a ☰ popover tree of scanned directories (counts, ZIP bundles highlighted). Click a folder to set the existing Directory chip. Optional Folders rail next to the grid for hopping between folders. The tree is a picker for a filter you already have; it does not replace the grid.
- **Sidebar layout** — Search and sort stay pinned. The long filter stack auto-collapses when model details open so the details panel can use the remaining height. Sidebar and Folders panel (popover and rail) are drag-resizable; last widths are remembered.
- **De-Dup on the current view** — De-Dup can hash/compare the current library filters (designer, tags, query builder, search, and other chips) instead of always scanning the entire collection ([#61](https://github.com/TechJeeper/Printventory/issues/61)).
- **Filament catalog and Spoolman** — Assign filaments to models (vendor, material, color). Filter the library by filament. Optional pull-only Spoolman sync of the filament catalog (URL + API token; Test Connection / Sync Now). Filament chips pre-fill on Log a print.
- **MCP Server (experimental)** — Connect a local AI agent (Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, and similar) to the library over Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` while Printventory is running. Desktop: Tools → MCP Server enables a localhost listener (same port as the Browser Extension, default 5000); copy URL or client `mcpServers` JSON from the dialog. Docker/server mode: `/mcp` is always available on the host — no toggle. Tools: `search_models`, `get_model`, `update_model`, `get_library_stats`, `get_folder_tree`, `list_tags`, `add_tag`, `list_designers`, `list_licenses`, `get_models_missing_thumbnails`, `get_thumbnails`, `set_thumbnail`, `add_thumbnail`. Agents can list models missing thumbnails, render images locally, and write PNG/JPEG back with `set_thumbnail`. Any client that can reach the endpoint can read and change library data; use on trusted networks only.

### Fixed

- Invert Filters is no longer clipped at the bottom of the sidebar when More filters is expanded.
- The sidebar scrolls again so extra filters and model details are reachable instead of being clipped with no scrollbar.
- Nested `.3mf` models inside ZIP archives no longer fail hash generation with `Invalid local header` / `unexpected end of file`. Zip extraction is serialized per archive and falls back to fflate/JSZip when `node-stream-zip` cannot read an entry.
- Docker/server Dedup no longer reports that every file hash failed when models already have SHA256 hashes, when hash generation takes longer than the WebSocket timeout, or when Windows library paths need to be resolved to the container mount.

### Database

- New on `models`: `print_status`, `print_count`, `last_printed_at`. `printed` remains a derived flag so existing filters keep working.
- New tables: `print_events`, `print_event_filaments`, `filaments`, `model_filaments`.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- MeshyAI and other Bambu Studio / Orca 3MF files now render thumbnails and 3D previews when the mesh is stored in a separate Production Extension part (`3D/Objects/*.model`) instead of failing with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'mesh')`.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Fixed error in Slicer parameter — Open in Slicer no longer passes `--single-instance=0` to Bambu Studio / Orca / Snapmaker Orca (that flag is PrusaSlicer-only and caused "Invalid option --single-instance").
- Slicer Settings name field is editable before choosing a path; browsing for an executable also suggests a name when the name is empty.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Folder and ZIP bundle grouping — models that share a parent folder or ZIP archive appear as a single card with a details panel
- Bundle 3D preview — open every STL/3MF part in a folder or ZIP in one grid layout with per-part colors
- Send to Slicer from preview — send the current model or entire bundle to your configured slicer (new instance on macOS)
- Query Builder, new Preview view, and customizable list columns
- New models tagged "New" until edited, parent-model grouping, LYS/LTY file support, and library disk-usage stats
- Docker/server NVIDIA GPU support, in-container thumbnail generation, and thumbnail progress UI

### Fixed

- Bug fixes and performance optimization

## [2.1.21] - 2026-08-07

### Changed

- Replaced Google Analytics (GA4) with GoatCounter for usage reporting. Still gated by **Enable Usage Reporting** in About.

### Fixed

- First launch after install could leave Electron processes running with no visible window (kill in Task Manager, then relaunch worked). Main window now force-shows after a short timeout, second-instance focuses call `show()`, Chart.js/Fuse.js are vendored locally instead of blocking on a CDN, and UI load has a timeout with `file://` fallback.

## [2.1.20] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Stats panel shows total library disk usage and per-type byte sizes (3MF / STL / Other) alongside counts.
- Grid multi-thumbnail carousel upgrades from list metadata (`hasMultipleThumbnails`) without loading full thumbnail blobs up front; default-thumbnail changes broadcast live so carousels stay in sync.

### Changed

- Bundle/archive details modal lists models instead of a contents table, with simpler layout and actions.

## [2.1.19] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Directory labels in Detailed/List/details now show the full parent path (including drive letter) instead of only the leaf folder name, so thumbdrive/USB scans are not confused with similarly named folders on other drives. Files in the root of a drive show as `E:\` (not a bare `E:`). Zip entries include the zip's on-disk location.
- Grid thumbnail hydrate no longer logs `Failed to generate thumbnail` / `Render task pruned` when virtual-grid rebuilds or scroll drops off-screen queue jobs (expected). Also prevents a prune from clearing the pending slot while the same file is still mid-render, which could start duplicate concurrent loads.
- On-screen models without thumbnails are re-queued after scroll prune / queue soft-cap. Virtual-grid was keeping recycled DOM cells and never calling `createModelItem` again, so visible placeholders could stay stuck on `3d.png` even though priority favors the viewport.
- ZIP/folder group cards and Generate Missing Thumbnails no longer stay stuck on `3d.png`: detached `renderModelToPNG` callers now pass `retainDetached` so the post-load scroll-prune check does not abort after a successful load (regression from 2.1.17/2.1.18).

## [2.1.18] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Desktop Scan Directory hung at `0 / N models` after 2.1.17: scroll-queue pruning treated scan dummy thumbnail containers as off-screen and discarded them (promises never resolved). Scan/batch jobs now keep detached tasks (`retainDetached`).
- Docker NVIDIA: stop calling `forceContextLoss` during thumbnail recycle/cleanup (it restarted Chromium’s GPU process and flooded logs with Skia OOM / `CreateSharedImage` errors). Soft-dispose instead, disable GPU compositing in the entrypoint, cap NVIDIA WebGL concurrency to 1, and filter residual Chromium GPU-recovery stderr.

## [2.1.17] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Server mode: 3MF preview rendered blank (0×0×0 mm) because WebSocket JSON mangled Float32Array/Uint32Array geometry buffers (#72).
- Docker/server mode: scrolling the grid into models without thumbnails no longer floods `get3MFImages` / WebGL work — prune off-screen queue jobs, cap queue size, fetch only top-scoring compressed 3MF images, and quiet verbose extract logs.
- Docker: suppress Chromium `ERROR:dbus` / “Failed to connect to the bus” log spam (start system bus when possible; filter remaining noise).
- Docker: Generate Missing Thumbnails OOM (V8) — stream path chunks, concurrency 1, pause grid WebGL while bulk job runs, expose GC / cap heap under 4g container limit.
- Docker NVIDIA passthrough was ignored because the entrypoint always forced SwiftShader; hardware path now used when a device is detected (requires `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES` including `graphics`).
- Server mode reported a hardcoded app version `1.22.5` (log/About); now uses `package.json` via `get-app-version`.
- Docker: V8 heap no longer hard-capped at 3072MB — auto-scales from the container cgroup limit (or 8192 when unlimited); override with `PRINTVENTORY_MAX_OLD_SPACE_MB`.

### Added

- System Report: show Client GPU (browser WebGL) and Server/App GPU (nvidia-smi + Electron renderer / GL backend).
- Docker: auto-select NVIDIA WebGL when a GPU is present (`PRINTVENTORY_GPU=auto|nvidia|swiftshader`); otherwise SwiftShader.

### Changed

- Preparing for 2.2 Public

## [2.1.16] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- Docker/server mode: Generate Missing and Regenerate Thumbnails now run in the container (hidden Electron + SwiftShader WebGL) so progress continues when the browser tab is unfocused.

## [2.1.15] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Show a modal progress bar for Regenerate Thumbnails and Generate Missing Thumbnails (including purge/load phases).

### Fixed

- Docker Fixes

### Changed

- Prepare for 2.2 Public Release

## [2.1.14] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Fixed failed thumbnail regeneration

### Changed

- Prepare for 2.2 Public Release

## [2.1.13] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- Faster cold start: bundle column migration no longer rewrites every non-ZIP model on each launch (one-shot zip-only backfill), and extract-temp cleanup no longer blocks window creation or readdir’s the full OS TEMP folder at startup.

## [2.1.12] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Fixed thumbnail generation for models inside ZIP archives: `get-file-stats` now reads entry size from the archive instead of `fs.stat` on the virtual `zip::` path (which caused ENOENT and left archive STLs on the default `3d.png` placeholder).

## [2.1.11] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where directories were being grouped. Bundle grouping is limited to ZIP archives (and `parentModel` metadata groups); plain folder siblings stay as individual models. Legacy `folder:` bundle keys are cleared on startup.

## [2.1.10] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Folder/ZIP group cards no longer aggregate every child thumbnail into a runaway `1/539`-style carousel; carousel is capped (12), uses one primary image per part, and hydrates without per-child badge updates or `getAllThumbnails` storms (also speeds up startup on large libraries).
- Bundle group card meta text no longer appends the long “right-click Preview” hint inline; overflow is clipped cleanly in list/detailed/preview layouts.
- Bundle details sidebar spacing no longer inherits the blanket `.model-details div` margin on every nested element.
- Folder/ZIP group **icons** no longer stay stuck on the generic `3d.png` placeholder: grid rows omit thumbnail blobs, so groups now prioritize `hasThumbnail` children, fetch the first wave in parallel, and cache results across virtual-grid recycles (fixes blank zip/folder icons and reduces long startup churn).
- Large flat STLs (e.g. ~400mm plates) no longer save blank/transparent grid thumbnails: thumbnail camera far plane now matches preview, framing centers after orientation, and clipped empty thumbs are detected and regenerated.
- Docker image now includes `bundle-keys.js` (required for folder/ZIP bundle grouping in server mode).

## [2.1.9] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- ZIP model extracts now always land under the OS temp folder (`printventory-extracts/`), never beside library files, and are cleaned up after preview/read, slicer launch, open, download, app quit, and on startup.

## [2.1.8] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Folder and ZIP bundle grouping** — When scanning, models that share the same parent folder or the same ZIP archive (2+ files) are grouped into a single row in List, Preview, and Detailed views. Single-file folders stay as individual entries.
- **Bundle 3D preview** — Click a folder or ZIP bundle to open one preview dialog showing every STL/3MF part laid out on a grid, with per-part colors for clarity. Up to 32 previewable parts per bundle.
- **Bundle details panel** — Double-click a bundle (or use **Open 3D preview** from the panel) to see path, combined size, print status, and a sortable file list. Chevron still expands/collapses the bundle in the grid.
- **Send to Slicer in preview** — The 3D preview dialog includes a **Send to Slicer** button. Works for single models and full bundles (all STL/3MF paths). If multiple slicers are configured, a picker is shown.
- **New slicer instance on send** — macOS launches slicers with `open -n` so a new window opens even when the slicer is already running. Prusa-family binaries also receive `--single-instance=0` when launched directly.
- **`bundle-keys.js`** — Shared logic to derive `bundleKey`, `bundleLabel`, and `bundleKind` from file paths (including `zipPath::entry` paths).
- **`npm run test:bundle`** — Unit tests for bundle key derivation.

### Changed

- Scan insert/update and `saveModel` persist bundle metadata (`bundleKey`, `bundleLabel`, `bundleKind`) with automatic migration on startup.
- Context menu **Open in Slicer** and preview **Send to Slicer** share the same launch helper (`buildSlicerLaunchCommand` / `open-file-in-slicer` IPC).
- `window.openSlicerSettings` is exposed from `slicer.js` for use from the preview flow.

### Database

- New optional columns on `models`: `bundleKey`, `bundleLabel`, `bundleKind` (backfilled on existing databases).
