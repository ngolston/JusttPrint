### Advanced Tools
- **Print Roulette**: Randomly select models from your collection
- **Tag Manager**: Comprehensive interface for managing all tags across your collection
- **Metadata Editor**: Bulk edit metadata for multiple models at once
- **De-Dup Tool**: Find and manage duplicate files with visual comparison. Scope the scan to the current library filters (designer, tags, search, and other query-builder filters) so large collections do not have to be processed all at once.
- **MCP Server**: Experimental Streamable HTTP endpoint at `/mcp` so a local AI agent can search the library, update metadata, and write thumbnails (Tools → MCP Server)

## Data Persistence
- The database and thumbnails live in the container's data folder (`/root/.config/justtprint`); mount it as a volume so it survives updates
- A backup copy (`backup_justtprint.db`) is written every time the server stops
- Manual backups can be downloaded through the Backup/Restore menu
- **Important**: Keep a manual backup before removing the container or its data volume

## Getting Started

1. Start the container and open `http://<server-ip>:5000` in a browser, then log in
2. Click "Scan Directory" to choose your models folder (a folder mounted into the container), or set STL Home
3. Wait for the initial scan to complete
4. (Optional) Configure settings:
   - **File Type**: Adjust max file size or enable ZIP archive support if needed
   - **Theme**: Choose your preferred UI theme and model background color
   - **Performance**: Adjust thumbnail settings for your system
   - **AI Config**: Set up AI tagging if you want automated tag suggestions
   - **MCP Server**: Let a local AI agent search the library and write thumbnails (Tools → MCP Server)
5. Start organizing your models!

## View Modes

JusttPrint offers three different view modes to suit your workflow:

- **List View**: Compact list showing essential information, ideal for quick browsing
- **Preview View**: Medium-sized thumbnails with basic metadata
- **Detailed View**: Large thumbnails with full metadata display, perfect for detailed review

Switch between view modes using the view controls in the interface.

## Print status and history

Each model has a **status** (Unprinted, Want, Queued, Printing, Printed, Failed) and an optional **print log**.

- Click the card badge to **log a print** (date, outcome, quantity, filaments, notes). Logging a successful print sets status to Printed and shows a reprint count.
- Shift-click the badge to change status without creating a history row.
- The details panel has a status dropdown, a **Log a print** button, and a history list you can delete from.
- Filters include each status plus **Ever printed** / **Never printed** (based on successful log entries, not the sticky status).
- Existing models that were only checked as Printed keep that status with “No logged prints yet” until you backfill.

## AI Tagging

AI Tagging uses artificial intelligence to automatically suggest tags for your 3D models based on their appearance and characteristics.

### Setting Up AI Tagging

1. Go to **Settings > AI Config**
2. Enter your API key if the provider requires one (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini). Local OpenAI-compatible servers such as Ollama or LM Studio can leave this blank.
3. Select your preferred AI model
4. Configure tagging options:
   - Maximum number of tags
   - Tag merging strategy (replace, merge, or append)
   - Category-based tagging
   - Detail level
   - Concurrency settings

### Using AI Tagging

- Select one or more models
- Use the AI tagging feature from the context menu or tools
- Review and accept suggested tags
- Tags are automatically applied based on your merge strategy settings

## Settings Overview

JusttPrint offers comprehensive settings to customize your experience:

### AI Config
- API key (optional for local OpenAI-compatible servers) and endpoint configuration
- AI model selection (GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4, etc.)
- Tag generation options (max tags, categories, detail level)
- Tag merging strategies
- Concurrency controls

### File Type
- Maximum file size limit (default: 50MB)
- Enable/disable ZIP archive scanning
- File type preferences

### Performance
- Thumbnail size settings
- Maximum concurrent renders
- Batch size for operations
- Rendering performance optimization

### Slicer Path
- Configure one or more slicer applications (name + path). The path is where the slicer is installed **on your computer**, not in the container
- Send to Slicer uses the JusttPrint helper on your computer: download it from **Settings → Slicer** and run the installer once. The helper downloads the models from the server and starts the slicer locally; the server never runs a slicer itself
- **Open in Slicer** from the right-click context menu
- **Send to Slicer** from the 3D preview dialog (single model or full bundle)
- On a Mac, the helper opens a **new slicer instance** for each send so models load even when the slicer is already open

### Bundle groups (folders and ZIP archives)

When a scan finds **two or more** STL/3MF files in the same folder or inside the same ZIP file, JusttPrint shows them as one **bundle** row instead of many separate entries.

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Click bundle row | Expand or collapse the files in the grid |
| Right-click → **Preview** | Opens **3D preview** with every part laid out on a grid |
| Double-click bundle row | Opens **Bundle details** (path, sizes, print status, file list) |
| Chevron (▸ / ▾) | Expand or collapse individual files in the grid |
| **Send to Slicer** (in preview) | Sends all bundle STL/3MF files to your chosen slicer |

**Notes:**
- Single-file folders are not grouped (they stay normal model rows).
- Bundle preview supports up to 32 STL/3MF parts per open; larger bundles show the first 32 with a notice.
- ZIP entries: the helper downloads just that file from the archive, same as the context menu.

### STL Home
- Set default directory for file operations
- Quick access to frequently used folders

### Theme
- UI theme selection (multiple modern themes available)
- Model background color customization
- Visual appearance preferences

### MCP Server
- Experimental: by using MCP Server you assume the risk; it may change, break, or expose library data to clients that can reach the endpoint
- MCP is always available at `http://<host>:5000/mcp`; Tools → MCP Server shows the URL and a client config that includes the API token
- Agents can search the library, read model details (including on-disk `filePath`), update metadata, and set thumbnails with a PNG or JPEG

## Tips

### Organization
- Use tags for easy categorization
- Enable multi-edit mode for batch operations
- Use the Tag Manager to organize and clean up tags across your collection
- Link related models using parent/child relationships
- Look for **folder** and **ZIP** bundle rows when a multi-part project was scanned together; right-click **Preview** to view all parts at once

### AI Tagging
- Start with a small batch to test your AI configuration
- Use "merge" strategy to combine AI tags with existing tags
- Adjust detail level based on your needs (higher detail = more specific tags)
- Review AI-suggested tags before accepting to ensure accuracy

### View Modes
- Use List view for quick scanning of large collections; bundle groups appear as one row with a part count
- Use Detailed view when reviewing models for printing
- Preview view offers a good balance between information and space

### Performance
- Adjust thumbnail size in Performance settings if rendering is slow
- Reduce concurrent renders if experiencing performance issues
- Use "Generate Missing Thumbnails" instead of full regenerate when possible

### Maintenance
- Regular backups recommended
- Use the context menu for quick actions
- Check for duplicates periodically using the De-Dup tool (optionally limited to the models currently in view)
- Use Print Roulette to discover forgotten models in your collection
- Purge models that no longer exist to keep your database clean
